Let's go through the code step-by-step to understand how it works:

1. The `Customer` class represents a basic customer entity with name and address properties.

2. The `Account` interface defines the contract for bank account operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance retrieval.

3. The `SavingsAccount` class implements the `Account` interface and provides the implementation for the account operations. It maintains a `balance` variable to keep track of the account balance.

4. The `CurrentAccount` class also implements the `Account` interface and provides an implementation specific to a current account. It includes an additional `overdraftLimit` property to allow for overdrafts. If a withdrawal exceeds the available balance plus the overdraft limit, it displays an "Insufficient funds!" message.

5. The `BankingService` interface defines the contract for money transfer between customers.

6. The `BankingServiceImpl` class implements the `BankingService` interface. It is annotated with `@Component` to indicate that it is a managed bean. The class has a dependency on the `Account` interface, which is injected through the constructor using constructor-based dependency injection. It provides the implementation for the `transferMoney` method, which simulates a money transfer by performing withdrawal and deposit operations on the account.

7. The `MainApp` class is the entry point of the application. It initializes the Spring application context by creating an instance of `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` and passing the `AppConfig` class as an argument.

8. The `AppConfig` class is annotated with `@Configuration`, indicating that it contains configuration for the Spring application context. It is also annotated with `@ComponentScan`, specifying the base package to scan for components. It includes two bean definitions:
   - `currentAccount`: It creates an instance of `CurrentAccount` with an overdraft limit of 1000.0 and registers it as a bean.
   - `bankingService`: It creates an instance of `BankingServiceImpl` and injects the `currentAccount` bean as a dependency using constructor-based dependency injection. It registers the `BankingServiceImpl` instance as a bean.

9. When the `MainApp` class runs, it retrieves the `BankingService` bean from the application context.

10. Two `Customer` instances are created: `customer1` and `customer2`.

11. The `transferMoney` method of the `BankingService` bean is invoked, simulating a money transfer between `customer1` and `customer2` for an amount of 100.0.

12. The `transferMoney` method internally calls the `withdraw` and `deposit` methods on the injected `Account` instance to perform the money transfer.

13. The result is printed in the console, indicating that the money transfer was successful.

Overall, the code demonstrates how Spring's IoC and DI capabilities allow for loose coupling between components. The framework takes care of object creation, initialization, and managing dependencies, enabling modular and flexible application development.
